            <p>
            The Storyboard is about a photographer Travis Selman. The scenario that I chose is a photographer is struggling to keep track of the photographics events that he managed. Now the photographer is struggling to find photos from an event that he shot last year. Then he discovers an "Photo Archive App" where he can store all his photos, which will help him in his business.

            <p>
               Our group created sketches of apps related to the locating of lost items. One focuses on a GPS system
                that helps locate lost items on a map. Another sketch focuses on the ability to share pictures of items
                that may have been misplaced. The final two sketches focus on a social media app that allows the user to
                post about their lost items with one sketch focusing on user response to posts and the other focusing on
                monetary rewards for lost items.

            </a>
            <p>
                Our team assembled a paper prototype displaying the location, feed, and post features. All of these
                features are organized by tabs named track, posts, and lost items respectively. The track tab allows the
                user to register and view devices that are being tracked. The posts tab allows the user to view and
                comment on other people's posts about items they may have misplaced. You can also create your post from
                this tab. Finally, the lost items tab allows you to edit your posts, view comments, and direct message
                people about your lost item.
