            <p>
            The Storyboard is about a photographer Travis Selman. The scenario that I chose is a photographer is struggling to keep track of the photographics events that he managed. Now the photographer is struggling to find photos from an event that he shot last year. Then he discovers an "Photo Archive App" where he can store all his photos, which will help him in his business.

                different types of situations where people lose their items and cannot find them again. The sketches depict how
                users can use an app to find their lost items again.
